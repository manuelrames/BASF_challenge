The challenge is to create a deep learning model, that can predict the disease rating, from an input image. It should be evaluated if a performant model can be created from the given dataset.

## Environment Setup üöÄ

_If your machine has a CUDA-capable GPU, make sure to install the necessary drivers beforehand. For example, I have installed CUDA 11.7 to be able to run models on my GPU._

_This repository was developed using **Python 3.10**, and so the package versions that figure in the requirements.txt file have been checked against this version_


### Installation üìã

_It is always advisable to install each project package requirements in an isolated virtual environment._

You can, for example, use conda to create it:

```
conda create -n envBASFChallenge python=3.10 --no-default-packages
```

Then activate your new environment:

```
conda activate envBASFChallenge
```

And lastly install all packages required from _requirements.txt_:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117
```

## Training the model ‚öôÔ∏è

To train a ResNet-18 model on the 5 folds divided from the original dataset use [train_image_regressor.py](train_image_regressor.py)

```
python train_image_regressor.py
```

If you want to visualize the training losses and results on Tensorboard:

```
tensorboard --logdir=runs_resnet18
```

and open your web browser on the specified output URL (usually is  http://localhost:6006/)


## Extracting Image Features With ResNet-18 model üî©

In order to train a Support Vector Regressor (SVR), we need first to extract the image features from the trained ResNet-18 model by executing [extract_image_features.py](extract_image_features.py):

```
python extract_image_features.py
```

## Training a Support Vector Regressor on the Extracted Features ‚å®Ô∏è

Once the features are extrated, we can train a SVR that will fit to the train+validation data, and test the results on the test data [train_svm_regressor.py](train_svm_regressor.py):

```
python train_svm_regressor.py
```
